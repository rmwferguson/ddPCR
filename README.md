# Digital Droplet PCR analysis
This branch contains two R scripts related to digital PCR analysis. Both scripts were written to handle output from the Biorad QX200 platform, but the main analysis algortighm (cloudy.R) should be able to handle any type of digital PCR output provided the data have the correct format (more on that later).
The two scripts are
- cloudy.R
- read_QX.R
The following paragraphs contain a brief overview of the functionality of both algorithms. Details on their use is also contained as commented text in the .R files themselves.

## the 'read_QX' algorithm


## The 'cloudy' algorithm
